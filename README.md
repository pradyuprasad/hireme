Hi this is Pradyumna! This is a list of things I have worked on from the past
1. My current project is building an AI agent for macroeconomic data analysis. I did a little bit when I was at the NUS Investment Society, and realised that this is entirely automatable with LLMs. Slowly, I have realised that it is [much harder](https://xkcd.com/1319/) than expected, but still quite doable. My project is titled milton and is available [here](https://github.com/pradyuprasad/milton).  You can see previous (live demo) of on [this link](https://sgdataproject-frontend.onrender.com/)
2. I used to run an economics podcast before. It is called Bretton Goods (yes, a pun on Bretton Woods) and got some interesting guests. Some of the episodes you might enjoy are [this one with Tyler Cowen](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2khX9W0OdwF3viAYSnnYe5) and [this one about institution building](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7at3bJxuBfo4f8XeOXyTmD) with Byrne Hobart of the Diff. The podcast generated over 10,000 streams total and at its peak had over 545 followers. I did it when I was in National Service in Singapore, and really enjoyed running it.
3. I also wrote an economics blog with over 2,000 subscribers (including those from the Prime Minister's Office in Singapore, leading financial dailies and financial institutions). It generated 80,000 lifetime views, and posts have reached the top of HackerNews at least once (that I know of). My best posts are this one about the [politics and economics of national development](https://brettongoods.substack.com/p/gambling-on-development-review), and this one about [why Pakistan has so many financial crises](https://brettongoods.substack.com/p/pakistans-next-crisis-is-guaranteed). [This post about housing in Auckland](https://brettongoods.substack.com/p/the-high-cost-of-expensive-housing) also was popular for reasons I don't fully understand.
